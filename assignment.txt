1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.
  Assume: table called 'cupboard' and column called 'drinks'

  SELECT drinks
  FROM cupboard
  WHERE drinks LIKE 'Jim%';


2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement,
such as a mnemonic.

I'm not sure what you mean by order of operations in a select statement.  The
closest thing I could find was order of operations in a SQL query.  I think
that's what you mean.  Please advise if not.

(F) FROM
(W) WHERE
(G) GROUP BY
(H) HAVING
(S) SELECT
(O) ORDER BY


3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:


******Inside database "catsAndDogs"****************


****Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column
may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

  -Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

  -Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

  -Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35 lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender='F' AND weight > 35;

  -Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE NOT breed LIKE '%shepherd%';

  -Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over
  60 lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60 OR breed='Great Danes';



4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

  -SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

It returns the name and adoption_date of all cats from the cats table.  See below.

name   | adoption_date
----------+---------------
Mushi    | 2016-03-22
Seashell |
Azul     | 2016-04-17
Victoire | 2016-09-01
Nala     |



  -SELECT name, age FROM cats;

It returns the name and age of all cats from the cats table. See blelow

name   | age
----------+-----
Mushi    |   1
Seashell |   7
Azul     |   3
Victoire |   7
Nala     |   1



5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
  -Display all the information about all of the available cats.

SELECT *
FROM cats;


  -Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name, gender
FROM cats
WHERE age=7;

  -Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for
  new cats.

SELECT name
FROM cats;


6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a
real world example for each.

=    -----> Check for equality.  Eg. Check if number of skittles in bag is 50
!= or <>  -----> Check for inequality. Eg. Check if account is not frozen
<   ------> check if entry is less than certain amount. Eg. Check if number
of audits is less than 5
<=    -----> check if entry is less than or equal to a certain amount. Eg. Check
if number of balloons in bag is less than or equal to 7.
>   -----> check if entry is greater than a certain amount.  Eg. Check if boat
length is greater than 56 feet
>=   ----> Check if entry is greater than or equal to a certain amount. Eg. Check
if sasquatch has traveled greater than or equal to 700 miles.

7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

The formatting on the single tick marks weren't correct, so I changed them.

  -SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = 'F';

  name
----------
Seashell
Nala




Again, formatting was incorrect from copy pasting into this text file, so I wrote it
in manually.

  -SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age<>3;

  name
----------
Mushi
Seashell
Victoire
Nala





The formatting on the single tick marks weren't correct, so I changed them.

  -SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;

  id
 ----
   3
   4
