2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

You use a database if you need to store data that multiple users can access at the same time.  You use a text file if only
one person or computer needs to access it.

It is declarative.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

  Each database is a table with column headings, row headings and entries for everything inside.
  Each column contains related data.  Each row contains different information about a specific instance (eg. a user)
  categorized by the column headings.
